# Real time easing animation helper <br>

This is easing animation helper class for real time animation.<br>
Android sensor's value (such as mic, accelerometers or gyroscope) is too dynamic to show real time animation. <br>
Values change too quickly so we need make it smoothly. <br>
Simply set target value, values between current and target value are made by helper class.<br>
